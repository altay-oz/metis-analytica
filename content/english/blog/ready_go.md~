I took the photo above when three of us were working as postdocs at
Université Paris-Saclay. During this period, we have worked in few EU
funded projects (H2020 and FP7) and co-wrote some peer-reviewed
articles. It was during this time that we decided to continue to work
together in topics that matter for us. We gave the name of Metis to our
new initiative. She was a mythical godess who became the mother of
wisdom and deep thought. Our logo represents her eyes. You can find more
info on Metis in
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metis_(mythology)). The image

We are specialized in quantitative analysis, our expertise lies
specifically in the statistical patent analysis but we are not limited
to it. We aim to contribute in building data driven strategic
decisions. The statistical patent analysis responds to various needs in
understanding a typical technological space with its actors. Combining
with social network analysis, we can determine various interactions
among firms. It is also possible to understand the technological
development over time and obtain the agents which shaped this
development. There are various fields where this information can be
used, a few examples are;

+ finding competing firms in a defined technological field,
+ contributing to the evaluation of an M&A transaction,
+ understanding the technological complementarity of merging firms,
+ antitrust analysis in patent cases.

By combining several data sources and carrying an econometric analysis,
we are able to achieve a sound solution for your research. We are using
mostly R and Stata, we can also provide Python code if needed. We also
provide all data with which we conduct our analysis so that the results
can be reproducible and controlled. Contact us to discuss your research.
